    "The diagnostic report (your puzzle input) consists of a list of binary numbers which, when decoded properly, can tell you many useful things about the conditions of the submarine. The first parameter to check is the <b>power consumption</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to use the binary numbers in the diagnostic report to generate two new binary numbers (called the <b>gamma rate</b> and the <b>epsilon rate</b>). The power consumption can then be found by multiplying the gamma rate by the epsilon rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each bit in the gamma rate can be determined by finding the <b>most common bit in the corresponding position</b> of all numbers in the diagnostic report. For example, given the following diagnostic report:\n",

    "\n",
    "The epsilon rate is calculated in a similar way; rather than use the most common bit, the least common bit from each position is used.

    "* In the third position, three of the four numbers have a `1`, so keep those three: `10110`, `10111`, and `10101`.\n",

    "* Then, consider the second bit of the 5 remaining numbers: there are fewer 1 bits (2) than 0 bits (3), so keep only the 2 numbers with a `1` in the second position: `01111` and `01010`.\n",
