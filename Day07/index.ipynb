    "A giant [whale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm_whale) has decided your submarine is its next meal, and it's much faster than you are. There's nowhere to run!\n",
    "\n",
    "Suddenly, a swarm of crabs (each in its own tiny submarine - it's too deep for them otherwise) zooms in to rescue you! They seem to be preparing to blast a hole in the ocean floor; sensors indicate a **massive underground cave system** just beyond where they're aiming!\n",
    "\n",
    "The crab submarines all need to be aligned before they'll have enough power to blast a large enough hole for your submarine to get through. However, it doesn't look like they'll be aligned before the whale catches you! Maybe you can help?\n",

    "There's one major catch - crab submarines can only move horizontally.\n",
    "\n",
    "You quickly make a list of **the horizontal position of each crab** (your puzzle input). Crab submarines have limited fuel, so you need to find a way to make all of their horizontal positions match while requiring them to spend as little fuel as possible.\n",

    "`16,1,2,0,4,2,7,1,2,14`\n",
